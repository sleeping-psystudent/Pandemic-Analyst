Montreal and Newmarket have confirmed community transmission, while Laval is suspected of having community transmission. Several other municipalities have reported cases but have not yet determined the transmission status.
Merck and GlaxoSmithKline continue to report shortages of measles-containing vaccines due to increased global demand. The shortages are expected to end in May and August 2024 for Merck and have no estimated end date for GSK.
The Public Health Agency of Canada has assessed the risk of measles outbreaks in Canada as high until the end of April, with a moderate likelihood of community transmission in the general population over the next few months.
